Logly is a digital space for museums & their communities to connect, share, and create. This project is primarily built on [Keystone 6](https://keystonejs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
with the backend using [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), & [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).

## Quickstart

> :warning: Before running this project you need to have a running postgresQL database AND proper environment variables.

- `git clone https://github.com/Logly-Studio/logly.git`
- `touch apps/keystone-cms/.env` (make sure to add the required environment variables)
- `touch apps/frontend/.env.local`
- add the following line to `.env.local` `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL='http://localhost:3000/api/graphql'`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

To Build the project:

- `yarn build`

## Requirements

This codebase requires the following items before you can run the project locally:

- **A self hosted PostgresQL database**. It can be local or in the cloud.
- **Cloudinary API token**. We use this for hosting any uploaded assets.
- **environment variables**. See below

In order to run this project locally you will need a `.env` file in the root directory `/` AND a `.env.local` file inside `frontend/` with the following items:

`.env`:

```dotenv
SESSION_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DATABASE_PROVIDER=postgresql
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLOUDINARY_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=xxxxxxx
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<insert system user name>:@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public
ADMIN_PASSWORD=testpassword123
```

`.env.local`:

```dotenv
API_URL='http://localhost:3000/api/graphql'
```

## Getting Started

> âœ… Make sure you have the correct environment variables

With our environment variables in place we can start the project using the following commands:

```Bash
yarn dev # starts Keystone in development mode on localhost:3000
```

That will run Keystone but we also need to boot up the Next.js app:

```Bash
cd frontend/
yarn dev
```

## Vercel & Railway hosting

Since the Keystone code runs on a Node.js server we use Railway for hosting the admin CMS and Database. All images and assets are hosted in Cloudinary with the static front-end pages hosted on Vercel.

## Cloudinary API

Cloudinary is used to host all uploaded assets.

## Monorepo

Logly's entire codebase is built using a monorepo which allows for sharing dependencies and configurations.

## Next.js

Next.js is an ideal React.js micro-framework for rendering SEO friendly static webpages.

## Keystone.js

For Logly's admin UI we are using a javascript based CMS called Keystone. Keystone CMS has extensive documentation and a very active community for finding support.
